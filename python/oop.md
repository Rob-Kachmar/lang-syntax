# Python Object Oriented Concepts

- Polymorphism
  - ```python
      # Polymorphism in action when a single function knows
      # how to handle different kinds of objects as expected.

      name = "Rob"
      print(len(name))  # 3

      lst = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges", "grapes"]
      print(len(lst))  # 4
